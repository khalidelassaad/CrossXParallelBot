"""
The goal of this file is to learn how to do the following things with reddit and gfycat
1. Download a gfycat file via Reddit API
    - Reddit API searches by site and downloads X number of results (by date)
    - "gfycat" package from pip
2. Edit the linked file (crossview -> parallel view transformation)
    - Slice along vertical axis and swap left and right data partitions
3. Upload to gfycat.com and save sharing URL
4. Post the URL to reddit

I am doing this in its own file rather than adding to the old bot because I want to try building the process my own way
After verifying my solution works, I will merge it with CrossXParellelBot.py
